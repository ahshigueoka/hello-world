# hello-world
This repository was created in order to learn the basics of GitHub by following the tutorial in:

https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

In the future, this repository may still be used to learn how to use Git without interfering with the work of more serious projects.

By the way, Unit Testing is another programming tool that I would like to use in the future, while I learn more about Git.

Seems like I have to learn how to write more advanced makefiles though...
