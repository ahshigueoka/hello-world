# hello-world
Just a dummy repository to learn git.

This repository was created in order to learn the basics of GitHub by following the tutorial in:

https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

In the future, this repository may still be used to learn how to use Git without interfering with the work of more serious projects.
